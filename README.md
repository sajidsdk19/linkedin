## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access

## How to Use

1. Navigate to LinkedIn's [My Network](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/) page
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
3. Set your preferences:
   - **Delay (ms)**: Time between connection requests (default: 5000ms)
   - **Max Connections**: Maximum number of connections to send (1-30)
4. Click "Start Connecting" to begin
5. The extension will automatically send connection requests with the specified delay
6. Click "Stop Connecting" to pause at any time

## Best Practices

- Start with a higher delay (5000-10000ms) to avoid rate limiting
- Don't exceed 30 connection requests in a short period
- Monitor the extension to ensure it's working as expected
- Be mindful of LinkedIn's weekly connection request limits

## Troubleshooting

- **Buttons not being clicked**: Ensure you're on the correct LinkedIn page and the buttons are visible
- **Extension not working**: Try refreshing the page and ensuring you're logged in
- **Connection limit reached**: LinkedIn may have temporarily limited your account. Wait before sending more requests
